ReactCalendar
=============

Calendar with selectable days built with Facebook's React.js

My first attempt at making something useful with React. 

Like the first line says, it's a calendar. You can select or deselect the days (as in they change color when you click on them), and you also change the months forwards and backwards.

Thanks to React's internal state, the selected days are always remembered no matter how many months/years forwards or backwards you go.


The code is currently not laid out for easy integration into another project but if you're half a hacker it shouldn't present any trouble, and someday I might package it nicer if it seems like someone might actually use it.



To see the React Calendar in action, just download the repository and open the ReactCalendar.html file. That's it.
